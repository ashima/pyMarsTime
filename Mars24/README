<h1>Mars 24 Javascript library</h1>
<h2>Christopher Lee, 2011</h2>

<p>This package implements the Mars24 algorithm based on the Allison and McEwan(2000) paper. Details can be found at http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/mars24/ . The entire package is contained in the mars24.js file. The mars24.html, mars24.css and mars24app.js files implement a simple web page that displays the time and date for Mars and the Earth using the mars24.js functions.</p>

<p>The mars24.js file is available under the Modified BSD license. Your use is unrestricted provided the copyright notice including the references to Allison and McEwan(2000) and Allison(1997) are retained. Publications using the algorithm should reference that paper where appropriate.</p>
